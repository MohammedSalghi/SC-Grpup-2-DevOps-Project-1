This initiative facilitates online appointment requests for clients or patients of medical establishments, including clinics and hospitals. This project can also help doctors to manage their appointment with their patients. This doctor's appointment system will organize the schedules of each patient's appointment, which will be submitted as a request to the doctor they have selected. The system comprises three key roles: administrator, doctor, and patient. The system admin will populate the list of the doctors with their specialties and along with the doctor's details and system credentials. The patients can browse the doctor's appointment system website to find a doctor that has the specialty of their needs. Patients can review the doctor's weekly schedule, enabling them to select a suitable day and time for their appointment. Subsequently, they can submit their appointment request. After that, the doctors can view all their appointments and the appointment request of the patients for their availability.
