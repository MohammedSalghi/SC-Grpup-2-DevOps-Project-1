Docker Hub Credentials Test - July 3, 2025
==========================================

✅ Docker Hub credentials have been successfully added to Jenkins!

Credentials Configuration:
- Username: mohammedsalghi24
- Type: Username with password
- Description: Docker Hub credentials for pushing images
- Status: Ready for use

This commit will trigger the Jenkins pipeline to test:
1. Docker image build (already working)
2. Docker Hub push (should now work with credentials)
3. Complete pipeline execution
4. Full CI/CD workflow validation

Expected pipeline outcome:
✅ All 9 stages should complete successfully
✅ Docker image should be pushed to Docker Hub
✅ All integrations should work (Jira, GitHub, JMeter, Docker)
✅ Artifacts should be archived
✅ Project should be 100% complete
