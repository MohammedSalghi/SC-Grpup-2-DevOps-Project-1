Git Fix Applied: 2025-07-03 18:10
Fixed the "fatal: not in a git directory" error in Jenkins by:
1. Adding safe.directory configuration for the Jenkins workspace
2. Configuring Git to trust the repository for both root and jenkins users

The Jenkins pipeline should now work correctly with Git operations.
Test build triggered after this fix to verify functionality.
