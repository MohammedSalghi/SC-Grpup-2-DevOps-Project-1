# ðŸ“Š Install Jenkins Performance Plugin - Step by Step Guide

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal: Get Native Performance Charts in Jenkins UI (Like Your Screenshot)

### Step 1: Install Performance Plugin
1. Open Jenkins: http://localhost:8081
2. Click **"Manage Jenkins"** (left sidebar)
3. Click **"Plugins"** (or "Manage Plugins")
4. Click **"Available plugins"** tab
5. In the search box, type: **"Performance"**
6. Look for: **"Performance Plugin"** or **"Performance Publisher Plugin"**
7. Check the checkbox next to it
8. Click **"Install without restart"**
9. Wait for installation to complete

### Step 2: Verify Plugin Installation
- Go back to **"Manage Jenkins"** â†’ **"Plugins"**
- Click **"Installed plugins"** tab
- Search for "Performance" - you should see it listed

### Step 3: Update Pipeline (I'll do this for you)
After plugin installation, the pipeline needs to use the performance publishing functions.

## ðŸŽ¯ What You'll Get After Installation:
âœ… **Response Time Trends** - Line charts showing performance over builds
âœ… **Error Rate Tracking** - Error percentage trends
âœ… **Throughput Analysis** - Requests per second over time
âœ… **Build Comparison** - Compare performance between builds
âœ… **Performance History** - Long-term performance tracking

## ðŸ“ˆ Expected Result:
Your Jenkins job page will show performance graphs exactly like in your screenshot!

## âš¡ Current Status:
- Your HTML reports work perfectly (performance-report.html)
- Performance data is being generated correctly
- Only missing: Native Jenkins UI integration

Install the plugin first, then I'll update your pipeline to use it! ðŸš€
